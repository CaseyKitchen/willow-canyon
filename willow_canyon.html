    <b>Environment Impact Before and After:</b>
</p>
<p>
    Before:
    During the time of the Vietnam War, dipterocarp, plantations, mangroves, brush land, and other woody vegetation covered around 25 million acres of Southern Vietnam (an area approximately the size of Vermont, New Hampshire, and Massachusetts combined).
</p>
<p>
    During:
    The dense forests that covered the uplands of Southern Vietnam also provided cover for the enemy Northern Vietnamese soldiers and their allies. For ten years, the U.S. Air Force flew nearly 20,000 herbicide missions to destroy the forest cover as well as agricultural lands. Approximately 10% of the land in Southern Vietnam, including 20% of the forest areas were sprayed at least once.
</p>
<p>
    After the Planes:
    After about two to three weeks of the spraying, the leaves would drop from the trees until the next rainy season. To defoliate the lower stories of the forest cover, more follow up sprays were needed. About 10% of the trees sprayed died from a single spray run. Multiple spray runs resulted in increasing mortality for the trees, as did the napalm strikes that followed the initial spray runs.
</p>
<p>
    Project Orange Illnesses:
    A chemical known as “dioxin” infected humans and wildlife resulting in illnesses all around. One of the illnesses that were known of at the time were Soft-Tissue Sarcoma, others that were not discovered at the time were Hodgkin's Lymphoma/Disease, Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia, and Chloracne.
